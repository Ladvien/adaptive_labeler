# adaptive_labeler
Yet another labeler.  Highly adaptive for labeling needs and speed, written in flet (for now)


## Issues
- [ ] Order of operations.  Randomize noise applies
- [ ]  
- [X] Break labeler into a separate repo.
- [ ] Save labels to folder above images to ensure it's easy to find.
- [ ] Make the CSV writer save relative paths and the config take the "root path" to ensure this automatically works on all systems.
- [ ] Create "Review" panel to allow viewing of past labeled images.
- [ ] Create a "change label" button in the review panel to allow changing the label of a previously labeled image.
